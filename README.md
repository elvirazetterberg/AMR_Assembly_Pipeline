# Pipeline
Bachelor's thesis/project to create a pipeline of python programs that can analyze whole genome sequences from campylobacter. The pipeline will return information on antimicrobial and virulent properties, as well as some information on the assemblies.

FASTA files: Branch in which all FASTA-files will be stored.
Programs: Branch in which all python scripts will be stored and updated daily.
Miscellaneous: Branch in which miscellaneous data that does not fit into the other branches will be stored.

Should add depend. packages for all tools, with verion etc. 

Text documents such as the final report will be stored in Google Drive.
